# Question and Answer App

This is a simple Python application that allows users to ask questions and retrieve answers from a database.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```

   ```
4. Enter your questions, and if the application does not have an answer, you can provide one to be stored for future reference.

## File Structure
