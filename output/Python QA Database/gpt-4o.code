# Q&A App

This Python app allows you to ask questions and searches for answers in a SQLite database. If an answer isn't found, you can provide one which will be stored for future reference.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (sqlite3 is part of the standard library)

## How to Run

```sh
python -m qa_app.main
```

## What it Does

1. Prompts the user to input a question.
2. Searches the SQLite database for a close match.
3. If a match is found, it displays the answer.
4. If no match is found, it prompts the user to provide an answer and stores the Q&A pair in the database.
